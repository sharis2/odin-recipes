    <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
           <li> ½ cup margarine</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flou</li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
           <li> 3 eggs</li>
           <li> ¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</li>

            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</li>

            <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.</li>
        </ol>
