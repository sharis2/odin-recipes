    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I like making this when I have nothing else in the pantry but bread and nutella. Easy, delicious, but sugary.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Nutella</li>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a dish wide enough to fit a slice of the bread, mix together the eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract with a fork or whisk.</li>
            <li>Spread a generous layer of Nutella on each slice of bread, then put the slices together to make 2 sandwiches.</li>
            <li>Heat some butter or neutral oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.</li>
           <li> Dip a sandwich into the egg mixture, covering both sides thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Fry for about 2 minutes on each side until browned. Repeat with the second sandwhich</li>
            <li>Slice into halves, and serve with a dusting of powdered sugar and some fresh strawberries.</li>
        </ol>
