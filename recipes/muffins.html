        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>you actually need to have a muffin tin for this but they're not expensive. You can change up the toppings as well. My favorite is strawberry. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

                <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>

               <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>

                <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>

              <li>  1 egg</li>

               <li> 1 cup milk</li>

                <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
                <li>Stir flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl; make a well in the center.</li>
                <li>Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup; whisk in milk and oil. Pour egg mixture all at once into flour mixture; mix quickly and lightly with a fork until just moistened. The batter will be lumpy. (Fold in additional ingredients if using; see variations below). Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
